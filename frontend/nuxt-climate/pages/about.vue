				<h2>Who we are</h2>
				<p>Cli-Mate is a web based application made by Codelivery Technology with a purpose to help climate preservation. By providing a platform for you to participate in reducing, reusing, and recycling waste from the comforts of your home. Over time, we hope that Cli-Mate can become more known to the public and can move their hearts to help us realize our vision and mission to make the world a better place for humanity. As we continue to develop our solution, we would like to expand our scope of work and be able to serve people who come from various cities, including small ones. To honor our clients and partners we work using a point royalty method where the points accumulate every time they donate to us. When the points reach a certain amount, clients can exchange them with coupons and vouchers.</p>
